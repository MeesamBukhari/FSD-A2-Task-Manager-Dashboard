# Dynamic Task Manager Dashboard

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **Dynamic Task Manager Dashboard** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **pure JavaScript (ES6)**. It allows users to efficiently manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, marking as complete, and filtering them. The app focuses on interactivity, logic, and responsive UI design without using any external frameworks beyond Bootstrap.

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Core Functionality

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add tasks with a title, category, and due date.
- **Edit Tasks:** Update existing task details via a Bootstrap modal.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks dynamically from the dashboard.
- **Mark as Complete:** Visually mark tasks as completed using badges and color changes.
- **Filter Tasks:** Sort or filter by category or completion status.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in **localStorage** to retain data on reload.

### 💡 UI & Responsiveness

- Built with **Bootstrap 5** for grid layout and components.
- Features a **dark/light theme toggle** controlled via JavaScript.
- Responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- Smooth CSS transitions and hover effects for enhanced user experience.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
